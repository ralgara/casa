# Casa

Minimalist, portable user toolset for development hosts running Linux. Implemented as a simple home directory template that, bootstrapped via .bashrc, it aims at setting up a fully functional hacking rig with a simple command. Clone this repo under `~/git` and run:

```
~/git/casa/install 
```

* Bash configuration (`.bashrc`)
* Emacs Live (`.live-packs`)
